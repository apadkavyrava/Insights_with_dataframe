Extract useful information about users behaviour from row dataset.


General assumptions:
1. Each row in the raw data file represents a brushing session.
2. If brush sessions are less than 2 minutes assume that is one session.
3. All session less than 20sec considered like random error. 
4. When a user brushes multiple times in a morning or an evening, record the longest brush and discard
the others.


	User Information: 
1. How many times the user brushed in the morning, and in the evening for each day of the week. 
2. How many days in the week a user brushed twice a day. 
3. The total number of valid morning and evening brush sessions in the week.
4. The average time spent brushing per valid session in the week.


	Group Dynamics:
1. How many valid brush sessions were observed in total?
2. What is the average number of brushing sessions per user in that group?
3. What is the average brushing duration per user in that group?
4. Which group performed the best?
